One approach to solve this problem is to avoid mixing units within the `calc()` function. Instead, try to use only one unit type in each calculation. If you need to combine percentages and fixed units, you can sometimes achieve the desired effect by using separate CSS rules and leveraging the box-sizing property.  For example:

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Important to include for predictable behavior */
  padding: 10px;
}

.element {
  width: 100%;
}
```

This approach makes the calculations simpler and more predictable.  Alternatively, in some cases, using JavaScript to calculate the dimensions might be a more robust solution, particularly for dynamic layouts.
